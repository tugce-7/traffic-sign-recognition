PROJECT

In this Python project, a deep neural network model is used that can categorize the traffic signs in the image. 
This model has made it easier to read and understand traffic signs, which is a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
This project "Traffic Signs Data Set" downloaded from Kaggle was used for. This dataset contains more than 50,000 different traffic signs.
It is divided into 43 different classes and the data set is quite diverse. The dataset includes a training folder inside the classroom and a test folder used to test the model.
CNN and Keras Appearance A project that can make traffic sign classification with 95% accuracy has been achieved.
